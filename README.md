*This repo was created in February 2020 in hopes of following up on an interesting TPAC 2019 breakout session.  That hope was overtaken by events -- the COVID19 pandemic.  It's here to document the discussion, and in hope of continuing the conversation in the future.*

# Overview

How should web standards organizations and the open source projects that implement the web platform evolve to better serve the web community? Tantek Ã‡elik ([@t](https://twitter.com/t?lang=en) ) organized and led a W3C Technical Plenary discussion of this topic in September 2019](https://w3c.github.io/tpac-breakouts/sessions.html#future)

About 40 people -- from diverse backgrounds,  with deep experience in web technology and standards -- had an [interesting conversation ](https://www.w3.org/2019/09/18-future-minutes.html]).  But in the hour allotted, we couldn't go deep on the questions or seek consensus on answers.  

This repo could be a place to continue the conversation.  We've seeded the issues list with clarified / generalized versions of the questions Tantek posed in https://w3c.github.io/tpac-breakouts/sessions.html#future . We would value input from web stakeholders about the missions and structures of the various organizations that create web standards, and what changes to them and their inter-relationsships could help evolve the web in a positive direction.
