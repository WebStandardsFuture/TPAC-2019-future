*This repo was created in February 2020 in hopes of following up on an interesting TPAC 2019 breakout session.  That hope was overtaken by events -- the COVID19 pandemic.  It's here to document the discussion, and in hope of continuing the conversation in the future.*

# Overview

How should web standards organizations and the open source projects that implement the web platform evolve to better serve the web community? [Tantek Ã‡elik](https://tantek.com/) ([@t](https://twitter.com/t), Mozilla, and at the time formerly on the AB, re-elected in 2020) organized and led a [W3C Technical Plenary discussion of this topic in September 2019](https://w3c.github.io/tpac-breakouts/sessions.html#future)

About 40 people -- from diverse backgrounds, with deep experience in web technology and standards -- had an [interesting conversation](https://www.w3.org/2019/09/18-future-minutes.html]). But in the hour allotted, we couldn't go deep on the questions or seek consensus on answers.  

This repo could be a place to continue the conversation. We've seeded the issues list with clarified / generalized versions of the questions Tantek posed in https://w3c.github.io/tpac-breakouts/sessions.html#future. We would value input from web stakeholders about the missions and structures of the various organizations that create web standards, and what changes to them and their inter-relationships could help evolve the web in a positive direction.

# Follow-up

At the subsequent TPAC 2020, Tantek led a breakout session on [W3C Focus and Shared Core Values](https://www.w3.org/2020/10/TPAC/breakout-schedule.html#focusvalues).
* Minutes: https://www.w3.org/wiki/TPAC/2020/focus-values (actual notes captured by the scribe)
* IRC log: https://www.w3.org/2020/10/30-focus-values-irc
* IRC logs minute-formatted: https://www.w3.org/2020/10/30-focus-values-minutes.html 

As this repo (TPAC-2019-future) is primarily for archival of the 2019 session, we may want to consider a new repo for continuing this ongoing discussion.
